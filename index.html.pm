◊h2{Hi!}

I'm Borja de Régil. I'm currently a research intern at the
◊l["https://software.imdea.org" #:ext #t]{IMDEA Software Institute} working on
cool dist-sys things. If for some reason you wish to know more, or want to check
out things I've worked on, just head over to the ◊l["/about.html"]{about} section.

I try to write some opinions on the ◊l["/posts"]{blog} from time to time. As the
title of the site implies, they're mostly wrong, ◊em{all} the time. Still, I hope you
can find some of them useful. I also keep (or try to) a ◊l["/wiki"]{personal wiki},
where I keep looser notes on books and articles I read, and even more opinions I might
or might not have anymore.

◊; TODO(borja): insert link to "social media" category here?
I don't do much social media, but I do have a ◊l["https://github.com/ergl" #:ext #t]{Github account}.
I tried to use Twitter two times in my life and both times I ended up feeling miserable.
However, feel free to reach out by ◊l["mailto:borjaocook@gmail.com"]{email} or
◊l["http://t.me/king_of_manlets" #:ext #t]{Telegram}, I'm always open to ideas,
comments, or just general electronic banter.
