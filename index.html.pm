◊h2{Hi!}

I'm Borja de Régil. I'm currently a research engineer at the
◊l["https://software.imdea.org" #:ext #t]{IMDEA Software Institute} working on
distributed systems with ◊l["http://software.imdea.org/~gotsman/" #:ext #t]{Alexey Gotsman}. Head over to the ◊l["/about.html"]{about} section if you wish to know more, or want to check out things I've worked on.

You can find some of my thoughts on the rarely-updated ◊l["/posts"]{blog}. I might
have changed my mind about some of the things written there, but I hope you can find something useful. I also keep (or try to) a ◊l["/wiki"]{personal wiki}, where I keep looser notes on books and articles I read.

◊; TODO(borja): insert link to "social media" category here?
Feel free to reach out by ◊l["mailto:borjaocook@gmail.com"]{email} or
◊l["http://t.me/king_of_manlets" #:ext #t]{Telegram}, or check out
my ◊l["https://github.com/ergl" #:ext #t]{Github account}. I'm always open to ideas,
comments, or just general electronic banter.

Feel free to ◊l[◊|atom-path|]{subscribe via RSS}.
